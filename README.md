# The Ship Performance

# Bussiness Understanding
Perusahaan pelayaran yang beroperasi di wilayah Gulf of Guinea menghadapi tantangan kompleks dalam mengelola armada kapal yang beragam, dengan rute pelayaran yang bervariasi dan kondisi cuaca yang berubah-ubah. Dalam konteks ini, pemahaman terhadap kinerja kapal menjadi sangat penting untuk menekan biaya, meningkatkan efisiensi energi, serta memaksimalkan pendapatan per perjalanan.

# Problem Statement
Permasalahan utama yang dihadapi adalah:

1. Bagaimana cara mengelompokkan kapal berdasarkan kesamaan karakteristik operasional dan performa mereka untuk mendukung pengambilan keputusan strategis?

2. Bagaimana memprediksi status perawatan kapal (Maintenance_Status) secara akurat berdasarkan data operasional agar perusahaan dapat melakukan tindakan preventif?


Tanpa solusi berbasis data, perusahaan berisiko:

1. Mengalokasikan sumber daya secara tidak efisien.

2. Melewatkan peluang penghematan dari armada yang lebih efisien.

3. Mengalami kerugian finansial akibat perawatan reaktif yang tidak terencana.

# Goals
## Clustering
1. Mengelompokkan kapal ke dalam segmen-segmen berdasarkan karakteristik seperti efisiensi energi, beban muatan, kecepatan, jarak tempuh, dan waktu turnaround.

2. Mengidentifikasi pola dalam kelompok kapal berperforma tinggi maupun rendah.

3. Memberikan insight bagi manajemen dalam pengelolaan armada, perencanaan rute, dan kebijakan pemeliharaan.
## Classification
1. Membangun model klasifikasi untuk memprediksi Maintenance_Status (Good, Fair, Critical) berdasarkan fitur-fitur operasional seperti engine power, kondisi cuaca, jumlah perjalanan mingguan, dan average load.

2. Memberikan sistem deteksi dini untuk kapal yang berisiko mengalami gangguan teknis.

3. Membantu tim operasional merencanakan pemeliharaan secara preventif dan efisien.

## Analisis
### Analysis of Cluster Characteristics from the KMeans Model
    
The following is an analysis of the characteristics of each cluster generated by the KMeans model.

Based on the clustering results using the KMeans model, four clusters were identified with the following key characteristics:

**Cluster 0:**
- The dominant Ship Type is Fish Carrier with a maintenance status of Good.
- The average Speed Over Ground is approximately 17 knots, ranging between 10 and 25 knots.
- The Engine Power has an average of 1,760 kW, with a minimum value of 502 kW and a maximum of 2,999 kW.
- The average distance traveled is 1,045 nm, with a range between 53 and 1,997 nm.
- The average operational cost is USD 254,956, with a range from USD 10,189 to USD 498,579. Analisis:
- This cluster is primarily composed of Fish Carriers that are well-maintained (Good status). The relatively stable speed and engine power, along with moderate operational costs, suggest that these vessels operate on medium to long-distance routes while maintaining their engine condition effectively.

**Cluster 1:**
- The dominant Ship Type is Tanker with a maintenance status of Fair.
- The average Speed Over Ground is approximately 18 knots, ranging between 10 and 25 knots.
- The Engine Power has an average of 1,789 kW, with a minimum value of 508 kW and a maximum of 2,995 kW.
- The average distance traveled is 1,058 nm, with a range between 50 and 1,995 nm.
- The average operational cost is USD 252,100, with a range from USD 10,092 to USD 499,711. Analysis: This cluster consists of Tankers with a Fair maintenance status. The slightly lower operational cost compared to Cluster 0, despite having similar engine power and travel distances, may indicate more efficient fuel usage or optimized operational routes. However, the Fair maintenance status suggests that these ships require greater attention to maintain performance.

**Cluster 2:**
- The dominant Ship Type is Bulk Carrier with a maintenance status of Fair.
- The average Speed Over Ground is approximately 18 knots, ranging between 10 and 25 knots.
- The Engine Power has an average of 1,748 kW, with a minimum value of 502 kW and a maximum of 2,995 kW.
- The average distance traveled is 1,002 nm, with a range between 52 and 1,998 nm.
- The average operational cost is USD 254,491, with a range from USD 11,376 to USD 498,862. Analysis: This cluster shares similar characteristics with Cluster 1, but the ship type is Bulk Carrier, and the travel distance is slightly shorter. The almost identical operational cost suggests that, despite the shorter travel distance, the fuel or maintenance expenses may be higher. The Fair maintenance status indicates that these vessels require regular monitoring to ensure performance.

**Cluster 3:**
- The dominant Ship Type is Container Ship with a maintenance status of Critical.
- The average Speed Over Ground is approximately 17 knots, ranging between 10 and 25 knots.
- The Engine Power has an average of 1,735 kW, with a minimum value of 504 kW and a maximum of 2,999 kW.
- The average distance traveled is 1,054 nm, with a range between 50 and 1,998 nm.
- The average operational cost is USD 261,368, with a range from USD 10,097 to USD 497,735. Analysis: This cluster highlights Container Ships with a Critical maintenance status, indicating a high risk in terms of performance and safety. The higher operational costs compared to other clusters could be due to urgent maintenance requirements or less efficient fuel consumption. This suggests a need for immediate repairs and operational optimizations for vessels in this cluster.

# Conclusion:

1. Operational Cost Differences: Cluster 3 has the highest operational cost, likely due to its critical maintenance condition and the Container Ship type, which requires specialized handling.
   
2. Maintenance Condition: Most ships with a Fair maintenance status are in Cluster 1 and 2, which may require regular inspections to prevent performance decline similar to Cluster 3.

3. Operational Efficiency: Cluster 1 and 2 exhibit similar operational cost patterns, despite differences in ship type and travel distance, indicating operational efficiency in Tanker and Bulk Carrier ships.

4. Recommendations: Ships in Cluster 3 require special attention to reduce operational costs and improve maintenance status, while ships in Cluster 0 can serve as an example of a more stable operational model.
